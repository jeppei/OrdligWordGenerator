# OrdligWordGenerator
Generates sets of 5 letter words that have no letters in common and each word has 5 unique letters (i.e. no duplicate letters). This can be used in the  ordlig.se game to cover as many letters as possible.

Here are 5 good words to use in the game that I found when implementing this application
- pjuck
- byxis
- helgd
- afton
- värme

The following letters are not included in the above words: qwzåö
